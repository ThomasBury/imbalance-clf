# Toy example implementing balanced accuracy and focal loss for classification

In this toy example, I compare different method on an imbalance classification example using an Open Dataset. Namely:

* Naive estimator
* Weighting the positive instances
* Using focal-loss + lightGBM
* Using the Balanced accuracy estimator from imbalance learn
